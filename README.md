# Bird-Strike-Analysis
A Comprehensive Study of Bird Strikes in the USA (2000-2011)
Introduction:
A bird strike is a collision between a bird and an aircraft, whether in flight or during take-off or landing. This term also includes other wildlife strikes involving bats or ground animals. Bird strikes are common and pose a significant threat to aircraft safety. Smaller aircraft can suffer substantial structural damage, and jet-engine aircraft are particularly vulnerable to thrust loss if birds are ingested into the engines. Such incidents have led to several fatal accidents. Bird strikes can occur during any flight phase but are most likely during take-off, initial climb, approach, and landing due to the higher concentration of birds at lower altitudes.
**Objective:** To analyze bird strike incidents in the USA from 2000 to 2011, identifying trends, impacts, and key insights to enhance aviation safety.
